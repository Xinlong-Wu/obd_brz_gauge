# OBD BRZ Gauge

English | [简体中文](README.md)

An open-source round car gauge built on ESP-IDF, running on the Waveshare
ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-1.85. It connects to an ELM327-compatible BLE OBD adapter,
reads vehicle data, and renders a touch UI with LVGL.

**[Demo video](https://www.douyin.com/video/7614174567678984187)**

> A derivative of [zhaizhaitao/open_obd_dsp](https://github.com/zhaizhaitao/open_obd_dsp)
> ([Bilibili demo](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV18oHXz6EiQ/)), adding
> multi-vehicle profiles, an ESP-NOW linked triple-gauge cluster and a theme system.

## Hardware & stack

| | |
|---|---|
| Board | Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-1.85 (360×360 round ST77916 LCD, 16 MB flash, 8 MB PSRAM)|
| Stack | ESP-IDF 5.5.3, LVGL 8 |
| Link | BLE to an ELM327-compatible OBD adapter (standard PIDs + manufacturer Mode 21/22)|
| Triple gauge | One master reads OBD; slaves mirror it over ESP-NOW with zero extra load |
| Sensors | RS485 brake temperature (Modbus RTU), ADS1115 oil-pressure ADC (V1 board; cars with an OBD oil-pressure DID read it over OBD instead)|

## Built-in vehicle profiles (17)

Pick yours under **Settings → VEHICLE** (applies immediately, no reboot).
Full comparison of protocol locks, oil-temp paths and gear sources in
[docs/VEHICLES.en.md](docs/VEHICLES.en.md):

`OBD2 Generic` · `ZN/C6 CAN` · `ZN/C6 PID` · `ZD8 OBD` · `ZD8` · `MX-5 ND` ·
`BMW F/G` · `Supra A90` · `BMW G OBD` · `BMW E` · `JCW F56` · `MINI R55` ·
`POS 997.2` · `POS 997.1` · `GIULIA 2.0T` · `jeep` · `Honda Integra`

Only the Subaru BRZ ZN/C6 has been fully verified on a real car; the other
profiles are configured but some still need road testing.

## Highlights

- **17 vehicle profiles** — per-vehicle gear ratios (up to 8 speeds), oil-temp
  strategies, protocol locks and addressing; gear display prefers direct
  CAN/DID reads, falling back to ratio estimation
- **CAN broadcast monitoring** — only `ZN/C6 CAN` uses the ATMA fast path
  (0x140 throttle, 0x360 oil/coolant temp); every other profile stays on the
  single-threaded OBD poll loop to avoid adapter contention
- **Manufacturer oil-temp paths** — Toyota/Subaru Mode 21, Mazda / MINI / BMW
  Mode 22, FCA UDS extended addressing, with automatic fallback when the
  primary strategy fails
- **Triple-gauge cluster over ESP-NOW** — the master broadcasts, slaves render
  with zero extra OBD load; real BLE pairing (master advertises
  `SkyGauge-XXYY`), survives power cycles
- **RPM warning (incl. linked mode)** — full-screen red flash past the
  threshold; in cluster mode the gauges light up in position order
- **Two theme systems** — compiled-in TOML themes (colors/artwork) and a
  runtime theme partition (custom page layouts), see
  [docs/THEMES.en.md](docs/THEMES.en.md)
- **Dual-path OTA** — the companion app pushes over BLE or a WiFi hotspot,
  SHA256-verified, with a 15-second boot self-check and automatic rollback
- **Boot animation** — OFF / RACE / VIDEO modes; VIDEO plays a custom
  animation uploaded from the phone app (360×360 circular safe area)
- **RaceChrono BLE output** — can act as a RaceChrono DIY device
- **Self-healing link** — re-initializes and reconnects automatically when
  data stalls; just power on and drive

## Quick start

### Option 1: flash the pre-built firmware

You need: the board, a USB data cable, and
[esptool.py](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) (`pip install esptool`).

```bash
esptool.py --chip esp32s3 -p PORT -b 460800 --before default_reset --after hard_reset \
  write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 80m --flash_size 16MB \
  0x0     firmware/release/bootloader/bootloader.bin \
  0x8000  firmware/release/partition_table/partition-table.bin \
  0xf000  firmware/release/ota_data_initial.bin \
  0x20000 firmware/release/obd_brz_gauge.bin \
  0xA20000 firmware/release/bootmedia.bin
```

- Replace `PORT` with your serial port (Windows `COM3`, Linux `/dev/ttyUSB0`,
  macOS `/dev/cu.usbserial-*`)
- A first full flash erases everything, including NVS settings
- `bootmedia.bin` (boot animation) and the optional theme partition at
  `0x620000` are not required to boot
- Full partition layout in [docs/FLASH.en.md](docs/FLASH.en.md); flash
  addresses are governed by [partitions.csv](partitions.csv)

### Option 2: build from source

Requires the [ESP-IDF 5.5.3](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/) environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/steveEcode/obd_brz_gauge.git
cd obd_brz_gauge
idf.py set-target esp32s3
idf.py build
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

The first build downloads component dependencies into `managed_components/`.
Before building for a different board, pick the hardware version under
`idf.py menuconfig → OBD DSP Configuration` (see
[docs/DEVELOPMENT.en.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.en.md)).

## Known limitations

- Data reading is fully verified only on the Subaru BRZ ZN/C6; other ELM327
  clones and vehicle PID formats are not guaranteed
- Brake-temperature / oil-pressure alarms are throttled to one alert per 30 s
- Trip / mileage statistics are runtime-only and reset on power cycle
- Theme switching needs a reboot (screens are created once at boot)
